Many people do not have the technical know-how to setup their own DNS server, so I created UncensoredDNS in 2009 as an uncensored alternative to the internet providers filtered DNS servers." %}</dd>

            <dd>{% trans "The internet should have more small decentral community-run non-profit services and fewer huge corporations running services with massive userbases. This is also true when picking email/IM/SoMe services." %}</dd>

I do keep graphs of the total number of queries, but no personally identifiable information is saved. The data that is saved will never be sold or used for anything except capacity planning of the service." %}</dd>

            <dd>{% trans "See the details on the DNS Servers page. They are placed on fast uplinks in professional data centers. I am actively looking for places to host anycast nodes, especially outside of Denmark or even outside of Europe. Please contact me if you can help." %}</dd>

            <dd>{% trans "The DNS server IP addresses will never change if I can prevent it. The anycast server in particular is unlikely to ever change since the v4 and v6 IPs are from UncensoredDNS' own provider independent IP ranges." %}</dd>
